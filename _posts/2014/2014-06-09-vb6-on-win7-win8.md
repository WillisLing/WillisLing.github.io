Hello Friends, recently I had to do some college Project in Microsoft Visual basic 6.0 + Oracle SQL Connectivity, but the hell Microsoft Visual Studio wasn’t simply installing on my Lappy, so after a few hit and misses at the goal, i have found the Foolproof Method for installing Microsoft Visual Studio on your Windows 7 and Windows 8,Windows 8.1 installations that too on both the 32 bit and x64:64-bit releases of Windows 7 and Windows 8 There are a lot many reasons which are responsible for installation of Visual Studio/visual basic 6, prominent of which are

* Compatibility Issues
* Microsoft Java Machine issues
* Installer/Setup run-time issues
* and some problems which ares pecific like unable to use visual Basic components such as ADODC,OLEDB,ADODB,RDO Connection problems etc
Lets solve each of them one by one in Detail.. :) but before that , there are some prerequisites which we must implement so as our setup will be much smoother… ***Prerequisites***

* During visual studio 6 Installation, it may ask you to install Microsoft Virtual Machine For Java,etc..and it may restart your computer continuously..so as a fix, simply Download the Following [Ms-Java.bat](https://copy.com/dSJMef1OXrKe/Ms-Java.bat) *{ Instead of downloading msjava.bat, an easier solution to avoid installing MS Java altogether is simply creating an empty dll called “msjava.dll” and placing it in C:\Windows\ . I have personally tested this and can confirm it works. To create and empty dll, simply open a notepad windows and save it as “msjava.dll”. }* file,and simply right click on it,and **“Run it as administrator”**,it will ask you for a confirmation,please select yes,it will open a box,and close that’s it!
* Now,The visual Basic 6 Setup wont prompt you to install virtual machine for Java,thus removing a hurdle!
* [Click here to Download Ms-Java.bat](https://copy.com/dSJMef1OXrKe/Ms-Java.bat) file for bypassing Microsoft Virtual Machine For Java..
* Now lets look at the Setup! The link to torrent file of vb6 setup if you do not have it [is here](http://goo.gl/rK2HDd)..>

**The First Problem which we encounter during setup is compatibility issues**

* This Problem can be solved by running the **setup.exe** of the visual basic 6 setup,by right click and selecting **“Run as Administrator”** option..
* it may show a dialog box like this — ></br>

fortunately,this Problem will Be Solved by simply clicking the Run Program and the Setup Started.. :) , as you are running the setup,its possible that setup might become too very slow on places such as “searching for installed components” , “finishing installation” etc..dont worry its,totally normal! just wait for the setup interface to come up :)
* Now you may simply Enter Serial Number,and Follow Next,Next Method of Installation and install Microsoft Visual Basic/Miscroft Visual Studio on your computer..***BUT!!***  if you follow this Method your Installation of Visual Studio will work,***but on 64-bit (x-64) OS,Windows 7 64 bit,Windows  64-bit*** when you try to use Visual Basic components such as Data Grid,Active X controls,ADODC Connections,ADODB Connections for VB-SQL Connectivity it will give error..
* The errors vary to a wide range depending upon the components selected and will be something as — ” failure to initialize provider,error 420,error 482,as well as the printer errors ” blah blah blah
* So, in order to *Make Visual Basic- Oracle SQL Connectivity we must do the following steps..*
Please Make sure while installation/setup your Visual Basic installation directory is ***”C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 6\common\”*** or ***“C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 6\”*** and **NOT**“C:\Program Fiiles (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 6\common\” or “C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 6\common\”

***Steps for Visual Basic – Oracle SQL Connectivity on Visual Basic 6 For 64 bit OS..!***

* The *(x86) suffix at the end of Program files is responsible for the failure of various visual basic components such as data grid,ADODB,ADODC,OLEDB,Active-X,RDO,Printer Connectivity,windows common controls etc..*

you can check this figure–> if it isn’t you may change the installation directory by clicking “Change Folder” or “Change Directory” as shown in the figure –> </br>

* Thus,we can make it Function Properly By Installing it to **Default Program Files Folder..And All the Data bound controls,standard controls,added components to VB such as ADODB,OLEDB,Data bound grid control etc properly,Windows Controls,MAPI Controls Properly..!**

***Also if you already installed Visual Basic To Program Files (x86) just dont uninstall Please..*** simply Perform the Following steps

* Copy the **Complete Microsoft Visual Studio Directory From c:\Program Files (x86)\ to C:\Program Files\ **
* Now Go,to the Folder C:\Program Files\VB98\ andtry to run VB6.exe , it will give error as “Failed to register extension and blah blah”
* Now simply run the “VB6.exe” from the non-x86 folder in **“Run as Administrator”** mode,. and voila!! Visual Basic Will Start Working,and all the Default Connectivity,Data Components which can be added from tools->components menu such as ADODB etc will start working!! thus , the **VB-SQL Connectivity too will start Working!!** ;)

***If you Encounter Sluggishness in IDE do the Following Steps*** :)

1. Using Windows Explorer, browse the location where you installed VB6. By default, the path is:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98
1. Right click the VB6.exe program file, and select properties from the context menu.
1. Click on compatibility tab
1. Check the following check boxes:
</br>**For Windows 7:**</br>
   * Run this program in compatibility mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 2)
   * Disable Visual Themes
   * Disable Desktop Composition
   * Disable display scaling on high DPI settings
</br>**For Windows 8:**</br>
   * Run this program in compatibility mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 2)
   * Reduced Color Mode (16-Bit Color)
Disable display scaling on high DPI settings
1. After saving open up VB6, It should work normally
That’s all! a quite-lengthy tutorial indeed! :) But Totally Working! if any Doubts/Problems Just drop a Comment below :) thanks!
